## Konstantin Dobler - Machine Learning & Software Engineering

I'm currently a PhD student at the Hasso Plattner Institute in Potsdam, Germany (the beautiful campus is in the banner picture). I'm mostly interested in generative models for vision (art!) and analyzing large pretrained language models. Also, I'm always looking for the next $\mathrm{\LaTeX}$ hack that helps me write better and better looking papers.
